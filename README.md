# Student-Management-System

The Java Student Management System is a comprehensive project designed to facilitate efficient management of student records in educational institutions. This project employs Swing for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that ensures a user-friendly experience, and SQL for seamless database connectivity and data operations. With this system, administrators can easily manage student information, academic records within educational organizations.

Features:

Swing GUI: The project utilizes Swing, a powerful Java library for creating graphical user interfaces, to design an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The GUI allows administrators to interact with the application seamlessly and efficiently perform various tasks.

Student Data Management: The Student Management System allows administrators to add, view, edit, and delete student records. Key details such as student ID, name, contact information, address, and enrollment status are stored in the database.

Academic Records: The system also includes functionality to manage academic records.  This feature provides valuable insights into student performance and allows educators to monitor progress effectively.

Database Connectivity using SQL: To ensure secure data storage and seamless data operations, the project integrates SQL for database connectivity. The application establishes a connection with the database to store and retrieve student information and academic records. SQL enables efficient querying and management of the database.
